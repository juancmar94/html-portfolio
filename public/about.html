<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hello, and thank you for taking a look at my online portfolio. My name is Juan Carlos, and I am currently an IT professional
  employed by Amazon. I am very interested in cybersecurity and am working hard to fill in the gaps in knowledge and skill that
  I need in order to transition into the cybersecurity field. Currently, I am enrolled in an Information Security Analyst bootcamp
  by Correlation-One. I am also engaging in self-learning via courses from Udemy, Coursera, and TryHackMe. In addition to this, 
  I am working on gaining more hands-on experience via projects that I am able to complete on my own time. I am hopeful that I will
  be able to acquire an entry-level information security / cybersecurity role in the near future.</p>
